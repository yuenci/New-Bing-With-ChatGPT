##  Usage
To use New Bing, simply type in a query in natural language and hit enter. New Bing will then use OpenAI's GPT3.5 turbo model to generate a list of relevant results.

You can refine your search by using keywords or phrases. For example, if you are searching for restaurants in New York City, you can type in "best restaurants in New York City" and New Bing will return a list of the top restaurants in the city.
